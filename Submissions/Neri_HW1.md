After looking at some of the data, it looked like many data points center around 300.
Based on that 'observation' and with the intuition that the values would be low for the rest of the semester,
my strategy became rolling a d20 die and then multiplying the result by ten.
With that result, I then subtracted it from 300 and used that as my prediction. Lady luck will prevail!

## Grade
3/3 - Great job! I hope that luck is on your side!
