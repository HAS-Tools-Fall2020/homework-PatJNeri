Patrick Neri; 9/7/2020 Assignment #2
This one was a little more complicated. While running my code this weekend, I ran into a repeated error where
my python script was unable to find my data.txt file. The error originated from the os.path.join command.
After doing some research, I created a Modified program which can be found in the assignment_2 folder in my
homework repo.
I am unclear on the exact changes I fundamentally made to the code, but was finally able to view plots.
This allowed me to see the sporadic increases of flow at some points.
I did not immediately see a pattern for when they occur, so I more or less stuck with my original method of staying
around 220 as an average and then introduced 2 or 3 'spikes' in the data.
