Patrick Neri HW7 Code Review

Greetings!!
This is a file to help navigate my program.

So email me if you have any other questions:
 pjneri@email.arizona.edu

 Feel free to run all of the script, and steal my plotting function of the months for the
 past 30 years. It is rather interesting!

 At the start, please download the stream data titled 'Streamflow_wk7.txt'
 and save the file in the Submissions folder. This should allow you to run the code.

 ### Make sure to run the stream flow from 1989-1-1 to align the dates properly!!

 Again, reach out if things don't work.
 **My weeks predictions are going to be the same as my models values!**
