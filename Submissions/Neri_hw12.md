# Homework #12
*by Patrick Neri*

### Major Difficulties!!
I found this week to be extremely difficult, which is probably not very surprising considering
the amount of information this week. I began working on the project late Thursday, reading thru
the assigned readings.
When I began to try and run the code, I had repeated problems with my environment, to the point
that at first when I tried to make a new environment, it would not allow me to install
packages. I eventually found some named file that I had to remove from my previous environment
and then install the packages I wanted in a very methodical way. Eventually it was working.

My major difficulty that I had was understanding the form of the data that I had downloaded.
I reread sections of the reading several times, but still cannot call what I want from the data.
When I look at what I downloaded, for some reason I can only see signs that it is giving me
information about one lat & lon position, I.E. just a time series dataset. I know this isn't
real, since the metadata describes the span of lat & lon that I chose when I downloaded the file
initially.

##### What I wanted
My original (rather lofty goal looking back now) was to create raster maps of precipitation
data averaged over individual months for the year 2020. Then I wanted to modify my big plot
that I have been working on to do just the months of 2020, and have a plot of the raster above
a line plot of both the streamflow data and the temperature at the site.

##### What I have
Not much! Right now I have a line plot of precipitation data for the location [35.2375, 247.5]
and a broken raster map that I don't think I am doing right.
(update) Just realized this may be due to me ACTUALLY using 247 and not the -113 recommended,
so maybe my data is from China? ... I just don't know ... send help

#### The Plan
So my plan is to continue working on this assignment and try and get this map working by the end of Monday, even if my slide will not be in on time, so that I will at least have something 
for class on Tuesday. Step 1 is try and redownload the data to see if I can find differences.
Step 2 is reread (again) some of the assigned exercises and see if I can find what I was doing wrong.
Step 3 is to get something working at least so I can show, and if all else fails, learning
from my fellow classmates codes on their repos to at least se what can be done.
Wish Me Luck!
